Reusable solutions for typical software design challenges are known as design patterns.

General reusable solution to a commonly occuring problem.


1) Creational Design Pattern
		Focus on process of object creation or problems related to object creation. They help in making a system independent of how its objects are created, composed or represented.

		1) Factory Method Design Pattern
		2) Abstract Factory Method Design Pattern
		3) Singleton Method Design Pattern
		4) Prototype Method Design Pattern
		5) Builder Method Design Pattern

2) Structural Design Pattern
		Solves problems  related to how classes and objects  are composed to form  larger structures which are efficient and flexible in nature. Structural class patterns use inheritance to compose interfaces or implementations
			1) Adapter
			2) Decorator
			3) Facade
			4) Proxy

3) Behavioral Design pattern
		 are concerned with algorithms and assignment of responsibilities  between objects. Behavioral patterns  describe  not just patterns of objects and classes  but also patterns of communication between them. These patterns  characterize  complex control flow  that's difficult to follow at run-time.

		1) Chain Of Responsibility
		2) Strategy
		3) Observer
		4) State
		5) Template
		6) Flyweight

4) Concurrency Design Pattern

		1) Read Write Lock Pattern
		2) Thread Pool Pattern
