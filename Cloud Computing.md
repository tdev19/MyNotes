[Cloud Computing]
Cloud computing isÂ ==the on-demand delivery of computing resources over the internet, such as storage, infrastructure, servers, databases, networking, software, analytics, and intelligence==.

Why?

	1 ) Cost Effective --- Its much cheaper to rent infrastructure as you need rather than buying and maintaining it.
	2 ) Reliability --- Almost all cloud providers have redundant sites with  periodic backups so in case of any disaster. Cloud servers can be up and running
	3 ) Scalability --- Most of the cloud providers have pay-as-you-go model. So you only need to pay for what you need.



Types of Cloud Computing

1) IaaS - Infrastructure as a service
		- We control --- software , data, middleware, Runtime, OS
		- Cloud Provider controls -- Virtualization, Servers, Storage, Networking
2) PAAS - Platform as a Service
		- We control --- software and data
		- Cloud Provider Controls --  Virtualization, Servers, Storage, Networking , middleware, runtime, OS
3) SaaS - Software as a Service
		 - Cloud Provider Controls Everything
		 - We don't need to install anything. We directly access the Service via web. no need to use local resources for running the application.
