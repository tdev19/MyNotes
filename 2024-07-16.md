I came to Banglore today from my hometown Jalgaon. It was a 24 hour bus ride.
I'm staying at my buddy Nikhil's place. Since he has gone home. I can stay in his flat. 
Its small but nice. I have couple of interviews tomorrow. I'm preparing for those.

First one is for HP at 2.30.
Other for Zensar at 4:00 PM.
